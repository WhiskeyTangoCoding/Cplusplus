/*	What is bubble sort in C++

      Bubble sort is a type of sorting algorithm you can use to arrange a set of values in ascending order.
        If you want, you can also implement bubble sort to sort the values in descending order.
        A real-world example of a bubble sort algorithm is how the contact list on your phone is sorted in alphabetical order.

		Bubble sort is one of the most straightforward sorting algorithms. In this sorting technique, we begin by comparing the
			first two elements of the array and checking if the first element is greater than the second element; if it is,
			we will swap those elements and move forward to the next element.

		This process is repeated until the list is sorted. For instance, if you have a list like this: 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, the
			Bubble Sort algorithm would start by comparing the first two numbers. Since 5 is greater than 3,
			it would swap the two numbers. The list would become: 3, 5, 8, 4, 2.
