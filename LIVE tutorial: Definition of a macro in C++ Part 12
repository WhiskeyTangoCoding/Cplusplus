/*	Definition of a macro in C++

		Using #define to create Macros		#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES		M_PI;

		A macro is a label defined in the source code that is replaced by its value by the preprocessor before compilation.
			Macros are initialized with the #define preprocessor command, and can be undefined with the #undef command.

		Macros are used to make a sequence of computing instructions available to the programmer as a single program statement,
			making the programming task less tedious and less error-prone.

		A macro is a series of commands and actions that can be stored and run whenever you need to perform a computer task.
			Use macros to automate actions that you perform repeatedly or on a regular basis. Record the macro steps.
			Build the macro with the editor. No programming skills required.
