//--- LIVE tutorial: There still is a 'bug' w/ in the ostream - Part 26

/**/
/*	There still is a 'bug' w/ in the ostream		**See Tutorial_Erik 00-01 Common input stream issues

		cin.ignore();
		getline(cin, fullname);

		Prior to adding cin.ignore();, there still is a 'bug' w/ in the ostream....
			In CONSOLE> Allows user to enter a single word/name for std::cin, but...
			then entirely skips USer prompt for fullname, and immediately jumps to next lines or ex to exit program.
			Thus, NOT allowing the USer to enter any further information.

		This is Why? The 'carriage return' from the KB entry is still left in the input [BUFFER]... So, when we "call" the geline() function
			-it then picks up that left over 'carriage return' remaining in the input [BUFFER].

		** To correct or fix, add in function cin.ignore();

/**/
/*	The memory for a <string> is a sequence of consecutive bytes, each holding one character.

			The amount of memory reserved for a string variable is automatically increased or decreased
			to fit the number of characters stored in the string as the program runs.

		A simple technique to avoid cascading errors is flushing the input stream using the ignore() function.
			The ignore() function reads and discards characters obtained from input.

		The get() function gets the next character from the input stream. The get() function is overloaded,
			meaning it can accept a varying number of parameters depending on how it is used.
