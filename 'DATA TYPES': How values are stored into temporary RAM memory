/*'DATA TYPES': How values are stored into temporary RAM memory

	  'int'  THINK? (integer values or WHOLE numbers) 1,2,5, 11, 56, 476, and so on... RANGE: - 2 Billion to 2 Billion (Stores 4 bytes)

	  'double' in C++ is a 'versatile' data type that can represent any numerical value in the compiler, including decimal values.
			  -is also a primitive data type that is used to store 'floating-point' values up to 15 digits.
	   REAL NUMBERS: There are two types of 'double' data types: Whole numbers as well as Fractional numbers with values.

	   ** Real numbers are numbers that include both rational and irrational numbers. Rational numbers such as integers (-2, 0, 1),
		  fractions(1/2, 2.5), and irrational numbers such as SQUARE ROOT of 3, pi(22/7), etc., are all real numbers.
	   ---
	  'float' A floating point type variable holds a number with a fractional component, such as 4320.0, -3.33, or 0.01226.
			  Floating-point numbers MUST contain a decimal point.
			  -is a primitive data type that holds floating values up to 7 digits.

	  'string' is: in C++, is an object that represents a 'sequence of characters'. For eg. string: "THis is a string of random T E X T !";
			   Note: In C, a string is actually a one-dimensional 'array of characters' which is terminated by a null character '\0'.

				 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
			   ------------------------------
			   | S | c | a | l | e | r | \0 |							null character '\0'
			   ------------------------------

	  'char' is: A char is a C++ data type used for the storage of letters. Char is an integral data type, meaning the value is stored as an integer (Dec).
				 It occupies a memory size of 1 byte. C++ Char only stores single character. Char values are interpreted as ASCII characters.
				 -is a single character such as 'C' , 'a' , '5'

/* Bool...  Boolean is yet another Data type: THINK? 'TRUE or FALSE' statements
					Simply put, a Boolean variable can ONLY have two (2) possible values: 'True' or 'False'

				 Boolean values declared 'true' are assigned the value of: '1', and 'false' values are assigned the value of: '0'

/*	The memory for a <string> is a sequence of...

		The memory for a string is a sequence of consecutive bytes, each holding one character.

		The amount of memory reserved for a string variable is automatically increased or decreased
			to fit the the number of characters stored in the string as the program runs.

		A simple technique to avoid cascading errors is flushing the input stream using the ignore() function.
			The ignore() function reads and discards characters obtained from input.

		The get() function gets the next character from the input stream. The get() function is overloaded,
			meaning it can accept a varying number of parameters depending on how it is used.

/*	#include <string>		The C++ getline() function:

		Is a standard library function that is used to read a string, or a line from an input stream ie. CONSOLE.
		-A 'built-in' function defined in the <string> header file that allows accepting and reading single/multiple line strings from the input stream.

		The getline() function extracts characters from the input stream, and appends it to the string object until the delimiting character is encountered.
			NOTE: In C++, the cin object also allows input from the user, but NOT 'multi-word' or 'multi-line input'.

			cout << name;  return Frank			If you use, getline(cin, name)		returns Frank West
				Whereas, cin >> USER enters Frank. Frank is only returned.

		What is the push back operation in string C++?

			C++ String push_back()
			This function is used to add new character ch at the end of the string, increasing its length by one.
