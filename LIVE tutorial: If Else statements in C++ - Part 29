//--- LIVE tutorial: If Else statements in C++ - Part 29

/**/
/*	If Else statements

		 if (test condition) {
			 cout << "This test condition is TRUE" << endl;
		 } else {
			 cout << "This test condition is FALSE" << endl;
		 }

		 Understand: A condition is anything that evaluates to 'True' or 'False'.
		 If (test condition is true) then return "TRUE statement"... If NOT, else return "FALSE statement".

/*	Definition of a while loop in C++

		The while loop C++ is a type of loop that will first evaluate a condition.
			If the condition is true, the program will run the code inside of the while loop.
			It will then go back and re-evaluate the condition. Every time the condition is true, the program will perform the code inside the loop.

		Like other loops, the do-while loop in C++ is used to loop through a code until the given condition is satisfied.
			It means that the loop will only terminate if it evaluates the specified condition to be false.
			This can come in handy when you want to run a piece of code multiple times.

		"While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met.

/*  FOR LOOPS and Loop ITERATION:

		'Variables': i, j (iteration of loops)... Recall, (Comparison Operators are used for testing)

		  /*1) Initialization (Start)
			2) Loop continuation condition (End)
			3) Increment x++  (Loop continuation)

					 1)           2)      3)
			for (int i = 2; i < fNumber; i++) {}

			Hence, Remainder is 0   ()

	    Inside the for loop, check whether n is divisible by i using the modulo operator ( n % i == 0 ). If n is not divisible by i, it means n is a prime number.
		    If 'n' is divisible by 'i', it means 'n' has divisors other than 1 and itself, and thus, it is NOT a prime number.
