/* What is Compile Time and Runtime?

		1) Compile Time:
			The instructions or source code written using 'high-level language' is required to get converted to machine code for a computer to understand.
			During compile time, the source code is translated to a byte code (0's, 1's).
			During this time, the compiler also checks for the syntax, semantic, and type of the code.
			So compile time evaluation means that the value of some variable was determined when everything is compiled into object files.

		2) Runtime: A program’s life cycle is a runtime when the program is in execution.
				-is the final phase of the program lifecycle in which the machine executes the program's code.
				-The other phases include: Edit time. When the source code of the program is being edited.
					This phase includes bug fixing, refactoring, and adding new features.
				-Run time evaluation would mean that the value of some 'variable' has to be determined at runtime.

		Following are the different types of runtime errors:

			-Division by zero – when a number is divided by zero (0)	-nan							(undefined)
			-Dereferencing a null pointer – when a program attempts to access memory with a NULL.
			-Running out of memory – when a computer has no memory to allocate to programs...

		** Errors: During compile time errors occur because of 'syntax' and 'semantic'.				** Share Examples_15-16 The stages Compile time...

			-Syntax errors occur because of the wrong syntax of the written code.
			-Semantic errors occur in reference to variable, function, type declarations, and type checking.

		** Meaning of statically typed language
				A statically-typed language is a language (such as Java, C, or C++) where variable types are known at compile time.

		** What is dynamically typed language?
				Dynamically-typed languages are those (like JavaScript) where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the
				variable's value at the time.

		-Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during run time.
				On the other hand, types in Python are determined during run-time as opposed to compile-time and thus programmers are not required
				to declare variables before using them in the code.
