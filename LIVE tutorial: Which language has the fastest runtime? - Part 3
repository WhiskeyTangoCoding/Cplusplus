/*C++ was used for creating operating systems (such as the Unix operating system), for real-time programming (machine, device,
  and electronics control), and only later began to be used as a language for programming conventional languages.*/

/**/
/*	Which language has the fastest runtime?

	Why is C++ the fastest language? One of the most important factors to consider when ranking programming languages is 'speed'.
		-is the fastest language according to several measures, including 'compilation time' and 'execution speed'.
	        -gets compiled directly into machine code (Binary 0's and 1's). Its layers (Hence, computations) are directly proportional to the processor.

	 C++ is a language that uses a compiler, not to mention it is a much 'lower-level' programming language than C#, Java, Python, etc.
		-For eg. Python takes 25 times more time to run the same algorithm compared to C++.

/**/
/* Is C++ language a 'Backend' or 'Frontend' programming language?

	   Backend: C++ is one of the most popular backend programming languages. Its features provide many advantages for building robust backend functionalities.
	   Its scalability and cross-platform compatibility, for instance, make it an ideal choice for developing complex applications that run across multiple platforms.
*/

/**/
/*	Is learning C++ enough for game development?

	C++ is often preferred for game development over other languages due to several reasons:
		1. Performance: C++ is a low-level language that offers a high degree of control over hardware resources.
		   This is crucial for game development, where performance is essential for smooth gameplay and graphics rendering.

/**/
/* What is an API in programming?

	Many people ask themselves, "What is an API?" API is the acronym for application programming interface â€” a software intermediary
		that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across
		organizations. APIs are all around us.

	Is an API just code?

		An application programming interface (API) is code that enables two software programs to communicate. An API defines how a
			developer should request services from an operating system (OS) or other application, and expose data within different
			contexts and across multiple channels.

/*	VS: Solution     Configuration		  Solution Platforms	(platforms you're targeting your code to USers)

		  Debug					 x64			          (64-bit O/S)
					                 x86			          (32-bit O/S) - Win32
*/

/**/
/*	What is BitLocker useful for?

	-BitLocker Drive Encryption is an integral security feature for Windows computers. It provides protection for your computer's operating system
		as well as the data stored it, ensuring that the data remains encrypted even if the computer is tampered with when the operating system is not running.

	-BitLocker enables users to encrypt everything on the drive Windows is installed on, protecting that data from theft or unauthorized access.

/**/
/*	What Is Big Data?

		Big data refers to extremely large and diverse collections of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that continues to
			grow exponentially over time. These datasets are so huge and complex in volume, velocity, and variety, that traditional data management
			systems cannot store, process, and analyze them.

		Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional
			data processing software just can't manage them.

		Do I need coding for big data?

			As an initial step to learning big data, you should be thorough with Programming languages like Python and Java. It would be best if you
				understood data analysis, database management systems, mathematical concepts, and the basics of cloud computing.
