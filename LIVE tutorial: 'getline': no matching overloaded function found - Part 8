/*	'getline': no matching overloaded function found C++

		Can you use getline() in a function C++?

			getline (string) in C++, is a standard library function that is used to read a string or a line from an input stream.
				-It is a part of the <string> header.
				-The getline() function extracts characters from the input stream, and appends it to the string object until the
				 'delimiting character' is encountered (ie. white space).

		** Character strings can be read in using the getline() function. The getline() function accepts three arguments, the first argument
		   is a char array, the second argument is the length specified as an integer, and the third argument is a 'delimeter character'.

				#define BUFFER 512

				char charBuffer[BUFFER];
				std::cout << "Please enter a random string of text, press Enter: ";
				cin.getline(charBuffer, BUFFER, '\n');

				std::cout << "\nYou've entered: " << std::endl;
				std::cout << charBuffer << std::endl;

		** We can use the ignore() function to skip over any trailing end-of-line characters that might still be in the buffer.
			-The ignore() function can take two arguments, the first being the maximum number of characters it should possibly read,
				and the second being the character that when reached will cause the ignore() function to stop reading characters from standard input early.

				cin.ignore(64, '\n');															                                                    Source: simplecplusplus.wordpress.com
