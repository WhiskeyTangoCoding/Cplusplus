/*	Definition of ASCII in Computer Science
*
	ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet.
		In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.

	ASCII, a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers. ASCII assigns standard numeric values to letters, numerals,
		punctuation marks, and other characters used in computers. The ASCII system translates alphanumeric characters and symbols into a computer-readable code.

	Scientific definitions for ASCII:
		The ASCII table contains letters, numbers, control characters, and other symbols. Each character is assigned a unique 7-bit code.
		A code that assigns the numbers 0 through 127 to the letters of the alphabet, the digits 0 through 9, punctuation marks, and certain other characters.
		For example, the capital letter A is coded as 65 (binary 1000 001).

/*	C++ Standard Library

		   -Collection of classes and functions available within the language
		   -Example functionality
			   -Strings / IO / Streams / Files
			   -Generic containers (vector, set, map)
			   -Container functionality (fill, copy, erase)
			   -Algorithms (sort, min./max.)

		   MUST #include in your C++ program
				-Referenced via. the std:: namespace
				-Namespaces encapsulate code
					ie. namespace bob { int ivar = 10; }
					Outside usage: bob::ivar
				-Standard library examples:
					std::string, std::vector, std::map

/* Containers

	Two types of container classes in STL (Standard Template Library)

		- SEQUENCE containers: organize and access data sequentially, as in an Array. These include
			vector, dequeue, and list

		- ASSOCIATIVE containers: use 'keys' to allow data elements to be quickly accessed. These include
			set, multiset, map, and multimap
*/

/**/
/*  Algorithms

		STL contains algorithms implemented as function templates to perform operations on containers
		-requires #include <algorithm> header file

		Algorithm includes:
			-binary_search      -count
			-for_each           -find
			-find_if            -max_element
			-min_element        -random_shuffle
			-sort               and more...
