/**/
/*	Definition of 'new' operator in C++		(Storing onto the HEAP)

			The C++ 'new' operator is used to allocate memory from the 'heap' at runtime. If there is enough memory, the 'new' operator initializes
				the memory, and returns the address of the new allocation, and initializes the block of memory to the variable pointer type.

			** What is the new Operator? - is used to allocate memory 'dynamically' for a variable or an object at (runtime).
			-This means that the memory is allocated during the execution of the program, as opposed to being allocated at (compile time).

			** Use of the new operator signifies a request for the memory allocation (on the heap). If sufficient memory is available, it initializes
					the memory and returns its address to the pointer variable.

			** The 'new' operator should ONLY be used if the data object should remain in memory until delete is called. Otherwise, if the 'new' operator
				is not used, the object is automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope (meaning off the stack).

	** In other words, the objects using 'new' are cleaned up manually (heap) while other objects are automatically cleaned when they go out of scope (stack).

			** Share Example_40-43 When to use 'new' operator...
				-The 'new' operator is used to initialize the memory (on the heap), and return its address to the pointer variable *ptr1 and *ptr2.
				-Then the values stored at memory positions pointed to by ptr1 and ptr2 are displayed. Finally the delete operator is used to free the memory.

/* What is a 'Memory Leak'?

			-In computer science, a 'memory leak' is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations
				in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released.	delete[]
			-A memory leak may also happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code.

			-'delete' is an operator that is used to destroy array and non-array(pointer) objects which are 'dynamically' created by the 'new' operator.
			-The 'delete' operator destroys the object created with new by deallocating the memory associated with the object.
			-delete operator works only for objects allocated using operator 'new' (ibm.com).
